# **App Name**: TaskMon

## Core Features:

- Task Mapping: Assign a 'map' (Pokemon region) and type to each task to influence available partner and encounter Pokemon.
- Partner Selection: Allow users to select a partner Pokemon for each task session that will visually 'roam' on the map.
- Session Tracking: Track pomodoro sessions. Partner Pokemon levels up as sessions happen.
- Pokemon Encounter Trigger: Determine whether an Pokemon encounter happens during break time based on task map, partner Pokemon, session count, and session duration. The partner is used as a tool when deciding which pokemon may appear.
- Pokemon Capture: Enable users to capture encountered Pokemon with a simple click.
- Map and Encounter Logic: Implement distinct maps with unique Pokemon encounter pools, limiting the number of Pokemon capturable per map. Allow for later map changes.
- Firebase Authentication: Enable user sign-in and registration with Google login using Firebase.
